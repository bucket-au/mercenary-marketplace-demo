In the demo I've included ancestry templates for Dwarves, and Elves. In the full version of Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, you'll find templates for the six common ancestries from the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook: Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, Goblins, Halflings, and Humans. Additionally to celebrate the announcement of the ORC license Orc ancestry templates are also available.</p><h2 class=\"stylish\">Stepwise Instructions</h2><div style=\"width:90%;margin:0 auto\"><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 1. Select Ancestry</h3><p style=\"margin:0;padding:0\">Select an Ancestry Template. There are two types of Ancestry Template provided:</p><p><strong>Ability Boost Templates</strong> will provide the NPC with the base features of the ancestry (darkvision, speed, ancestry HP, etc.), benefits or penalties based on the Ability Boosts granted by that ancestry, and prompt you to select a heritage for that ancestry from those listed in Step 2.</p><p style=\"margin-left:2em\">@Compendium[pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-templates.yy7t29NuTsHteB8I]{Ancestry, Dwarf (Ability Boosts)} @Compendium[pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-templates.ybW6A5BAywolnzJr]{Ancestry, Elf (Ability Boosts)} Ancestry, Gnome (Ability Boosts), Ancestry, Goblin (Ability Boosts), Ancestry, Halfling (Ability Boosts), Ancestry, Human (Ability Boosts)</p><p>      <strong>Heritage Only Templates</strong> will provide only the base features of the ancestry (darkvision, speed, ancestry HP), and prompt you to select a heritage for that ancestry from those listed in Step 2.</p><p style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-after:1em\">@Compendium[pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-templates.Nu01ejqWcdDb14oW]{Ancestry, Dwarf (Heritage Only)} @Compendium[pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-templates.DN5k4nQb6XUCeuCd]{Ancestry, Elf (Heritage Only)} Ancestry, Gnome (Heritage Only), Ancestry, Goblin (Heritage Only), Ancestry, Halfling (Heritage Only), Ancestry, Human (Heritage Only)</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 2.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Ancestry Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, a prompt will pop up asking which heritage you would like to apply to your NPC. The prompt will present a dropdown with the list of included heritages for that ancestry. If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC. To ensure there were an acceptable number of heritages available for each ancestry, additional heritages were invented that were inspired by a level 1 ancestry feat from that ancestry. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Credits & License","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h2 class=\"stylish\">Credits</h2><div style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-top:0.5em\"><p><strong>Authorship</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Game Design </strong>- Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>- Amanda</p><p><strong>Beta Testing </strong>- InfamousSky &amp; SkepticRobot</p><p><strong>The PF2e Foundry Team &amp; Discord Community</strong> - without the tireless efforts of which none of this could exist.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew. You can accomplish this  by creating a Crew with less Crew Abilities than usual. </p><p><strong>Crews with Descriptive Templates -</strong> The math for Crews has been constructed to scale with the Base Creature's level. If you wish to apply a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}, you should apply it first, before applying the Crew template, to ensure the Crew template functions as intended.</p><p><em><strong>Caution</strong></em> - Stacking Crew and Descriptive templates may produce results that are more or less powerful than expected based on the listed level adjustments.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Lore Justification</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Why are Crews, groups of 4 to 6 individuals, affected by magic and other effects as if they are a single creature? While I can certainly provide a number of mechanical and balance reasons, I believe that a satisfying answer needs to make sense within the world.</p><p>The default lore for how Crews work is sympathetic magic. By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew. I've got several possible explanations for the underlying cause of this sympathetic magic; feel free to pick your favourite for your world, include different explanations for different Crews, or invent your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual -</strong> The crew has undergone a ritual blending of blood, sharing of tattoos, or similar process which binds them together for good or for ill. This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression. Hopefully you'll find it as satisfying in play as I do.</p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted. In a campaign where you are making extensive use of Crews you will want to reward the party with loot from other sources, for example, story rewards or loot from bosses.  While you can add additional copies of each item carried by the Crew to more accurately represent all the arms and armour carried by the crew, doing so results in the party receiving a lot of low level gear that is, in my experience, not worth tracking.</p><p>As is typical for the NPCs presented in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, Crews are presented with the bare minimum for gear, based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing solely on fundamental rune progression. When adapting these Crews for use in your games as adversaries, you may wish to equip your Crews with additional consumables that are narratively appropriate. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Descriptive Templates","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Personality</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a collection of templates that allow you to modify your NPCs based on a descriptive adjective.

Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the Descriptive Templates will require small adjustments that could not be automated. If the NPC's maximum HP has increased after the application of the template, you will need to adjust their current HP to match their new maximum. If your base creature has non-strike effects or abilities that deal damage, the damage of these abilities will need to be manually adjusted according to the instructions on each template. This is also an opportune time to review your chosen template for other required manual adjustments.

the majority of any campaign.</p><p>Melee characters are listed with a range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p>Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party. If you are looking to challenge a high level party with generic underlings, either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.LVylAkC1NWnXxLul]{Troops} may be more suitable while maintaining a stronger sense of progression. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These NPCs have been designed to emulate player classes, although in many cases abilities have been simplified, condensed or reflavoured to make the NPCs easier to run for GMs. To appropriately capture the flavour of their respective classes, these NPCs with Class tend to have more abilities, than the other NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, making them more complex to run. These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon or upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. The NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental rules (+x potency rules, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">These NPCs are designed to have lower complexity than the NPCs with Classes and are particularly appropriate for use as supporting characters. For major named antagonists it may be beneficial to select one to two feats from an appropriate class, ancestry or skill to expand upon their versatility and make for a more complex villain. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">For higher level threats, the intention is that individual NPCs of this sort stop being a threat to the party, and you need to transition to using @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews}. I've intentionally not created any NPCs with jobs over level 12 to explicitly encourage this transition.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>In making these NPCs I have split them into seven different combat roles. Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

Given that inline rolls are the primary sort of damage roll used for troops, each troop is presented at a single level only rather than a level range. I don't recommend trying to modify your troops with the Weak and Elite adjustments unless you're prepared to make a number of manual adjustments.</p><p>Troops have been presented as Gargantuan creatures to reflect the rules, however, if you wish to have troops that can alter their shape per the rules in Form Up, you will wish to adjust the size to medium and place 16 medium tokens all linked to the initial imported actor. This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks. For troops that mostly rely on ranged damage or spellcasting, this adjustment is unnecessary. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Troop Creation Guidelines</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Full version of Mercenary Marketplace contains guidelines for creating your own troops.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>I find the weakness of Paizo's troops to Area Effect spells to be very unsatisfying, the weakness has the same effect whether you spend a first level burning hands spell or a 10th level meteor swarm. Whereas I feel that a higher level area effect spell used on a troop should produce a proportionately greater effect. My solution to address this grip was is to replace the weakness with a Area Effect Vulnerability, which decreases the degree of success for troops against area effect spells, thus making their effectiveness naturally scale with the power of the spell. If you find you'd prefer the standard troop weaknesses, remove the Troop Area Effect Vulnerability and give the troop a weakness with a value equal to double its listed weakness to splash damage.</p><p>Wherever possible I've chosen to create abilities for these troops that reflect the fantasy evoked by the troop's name.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Ancestry Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, a prompt will pop up asking which heritage you would like to apply to your NPC. The prompt will present a dropdown with the list of included heritages for that ancestry. If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC. To ensure there were an acceptable number of heritages available for each ancestry, additional heritages were invented that were inspired by a level 1 ancestry feat from that ancestry. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Credits & License","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h2 class=\"stylish\">Credits</h2><div style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-top:0.5em\"><p><strong>Authorship</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Game Design </strong>- Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>- Amanda</p><p><strong>Beta Testing </strong>- InfamousSky &amp; SkepticRobot</p><p><strong>The PF2e Foundry Team &amp; Discord Community</strong> - without the tireless efforts of which none of this could exist.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew. You can accomplish this  by creating a Crew with less Crew Abilities than usual. </p><p><strong>Crews with Descriptive Templates -</strong> The math for Crews has been constructed to scale with the Base Creature's level. If you wish to apply a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}, you should apply it first, before applying the Crew template, to ensure the Crew template functions as intended.</p><p><em><strong>Caution</strong></em> - Stacking Crew and Descriptive templates may produce results that are more or less powerful than expected based on the listed level adjustments.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Lore Justification</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Why are Crews, groups of 4 to 6 individuals, affected by magic and other effects as if they are a single creature?

By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew.

This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression. Hopefully you'll find it as satisfying in play as I do.</p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted. In a campaign where you are making extensive use of Crews you will want to reward the party with loot from other sources, for example, story rewards or loot from bosses.  While you can add additional copies of each item carried by the Crew to more accurately represent all the arms and armour carried by the crew, doing so results in the party receiving a lot of low level gear that is, in my experience, not worth tracking.</p><p>As is typical for the NPCs presented in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, Crews are presented with the bare minimum for gear, based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing solely on fundamental rune progression.

You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party.

These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Ancestry Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, a prompt will pop up asking which heritage you would like to apply to your NPC. The prompt will present a dropdown with the list of included heritages for that ancestry. If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC.

Any creature with the Crew trait is treated as a single creature for the purposes of spells and effects. However, it may be selected twice for abilities that require you to select two adjacent creatures, such as swipe.</p><p>Below you will find a description of how to use the templates in the full of the module.</p><h2 class=\"stylish\">Instructions</h2><div style=\"width:90%;margin:0 auto\"><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 1. Select Template</h3><p>Select a Crew Template. There are two Crew Templates provided.</p><p>The <strong>Ragtag Crew Template</strong> which produces a Crew with a level 2-higher than that of the base creature.</p><p>The <strong>Crew Template</strong> which produces a Crew with a level 4-higher than that of the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 2. Select Abilities</h3><p>Select Crew Abilities from the table below for your Crew. Select 1 ability if you are creating a Ragtag Crew or 2 if you are creating a standard Crew.</p><p>These abilities represent special training or capabilities the Crew has developed as a group. The abilities have been divided into Universal Abilities that are useful to all Crews, and Spellcaster Exclusive Abilities that are only useful if the base creature is a spellcaster. Please note that Simultaneous Casting and United Casting are mutually exclusive abilities.</p><table style=\"width:100%;border-style:hidden\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:19px\"><td style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;background-color:#050e18;height:19px\"><strong>Universal Abilities</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><table style=\"width:100%;border-style:hidden\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:50%;color:#050e18\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Back to Back</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Bodyguard Training</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Collateral Damage</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Collective Reflexes</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Concentrated Assault</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Diversified Strikes</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Formation Training</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Frontline Protection</strong></p></td><td style=\"width:50%;color:#050e18\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Guarded Retreat</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Harrying Vanguard</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Perceptive Crew</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Reactive Punishment</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Scattered Shots</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Shared Defence</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Skilled Teamwork</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Team Flanking</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><table style=\"width:100%;border-style:hidden\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:19px\"><td style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;background-color:#050e18;height:19px\"><strong>Spellcaster Exclusive Abilities</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><table style=\"width:100%;border-style:hidden\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:50%;color:#050e18\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Collaborative Sustain</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Joint Summoning</strong></p></td><td style=\"width:50%;color:#050e18\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>Simultaneous Casting</strong></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;text-align:start\"><strong>United Casting</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 3. Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew. You can accomplish this  by creating a Crew with less Crew Abilities than usual. </p><p><strong>Crews with Descriptive Templates -</strong> The math for Crews has been constructed to scale with the Base Creature's level. If you wish to apply a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}, you should apply it first, before applying the Crew template, to ensure the Crew template functions as intended.</p><p><em><strong>Caution</strong></em> - Stacking Crew and Descriptive templates may produce results that are more or less powerful than expected based on the listed level adjustments.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Lore Justification</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Why are Crews, groups of 4 to 6 individuals, affected by magic and other effects as if they are a single creature? While I can certainly provide a number of mechanical and balance reasons, I believe that a satisfying answer needs to make sense within the world.</p><p>The default lore for how Crews work is sympathetic magic. By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew. I've got several possible explanations for the underlying cause of this sympathetic magic; feel free to pick your favourite for your world, include different explanations for different Crews, or invent your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual -</strong> The crew has undergone a ritual blending of blood, sharing of tattoos, or similar process which binds them together for good or for ill. This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression.

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted. In a campaign where you are making extensive use of Crews you will want to reward the party with loot from other sources, for example, story rewards or loot from bosses.  While you can add additional copies of each item carried by the Crew to more accurately represent all the arms and armour carried by the crew, doing so results in the party receiving a lot of low level gear that is, in my experience, not worth tracking.</p><p>As is typical for the NPCs presented in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, Crews are presented with the bare minimum for gear, based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing solely on fundamental rune progression. When adapting these Crews for use in your games as adversaries, you may wish to equip your Crews with additional consumables that are narratively appropriate. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Descriptive Templates","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Personality</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a collection of templates that allow you to modify your NPCs based on a descriptive adjective.

Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the Descriptive Templates will require small adjustments that could not be automated. If the NPC's maximum HP has increased after the application of the template, you will need to adjust their current HP to match their new maximum. If your base creature has non-strike effects or abilities that deal damage, the damage of these abilities will need to be manually adjusted according to the instructions on each template. This is also an opportune time to review your chosen template for other required manual adjustments.

the majority of any campaign.</p><p>Melee characters are listed with a range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p>Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party.

These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon or upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. The NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental rules (+x potency rules, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">These NPCs are designed to have lower complexity than the NPCs with Classes and are particularly appropriate for use as supporting characters. For major named antagonists it may be beneficial to select one to two feats from an appropriate class, ancestry or skill to expand upon their versatility and make for a more complex villain. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">For higher level threats, the intention is that individual NPCs of this sort stop being a threat to the party, and you need to transition to using @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews}. I've intentionally not created any NPCs with jobs over level 12 to explicitly encourage this transition.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>In making these NPCs I have split them into seven different combat roles. Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

I don't recommend trying to modify your troops with the Weak and Elite adjustments unless you're prepared to make a number of manual adjustments.</p><p>Troops have been presented as Gargantuan creatures to reflect the rules, however, if you wish to have troops that can alter their shape per the rules in Form Up, you will wish to adjust the size to medium and place 16 medium tokens all linked to the initial imported actor. This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks. For troops that mostly rely on ranged damage or spellcasting, this adjustment is unnecessary. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Troop Creation Guidelines</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Full version of Mercenary Marketplace contains guidelines for creating your own troops.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>I find the weakness of Paizo's troops to Area Effect spells to be very unsatisfying, the weakness has the same effect whether you spend a first level burning hands spell or a 10th level meteor swarm.

My solution to address this grip was is to replace the weakness with a Area Effect Vulnerability, which decreases the degree of success for troops against area effect spells, thus making their effectiveness naturally scale with the power of the spell. If you find you'd prefer the standard troop weaknesses, remove the Troop Area Effect Vulnerability and give the troop a weakness with a value equal to double its listed weakness to splash damage.</p><p>Wherever possible I've chosen to create abilities for these troops that reflect the fantasy evoked by the troop's name.

In the demo I've included ancestry templates for Dwarves, and Elves. In the full version of Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, you'll find templates for the six common ancestries from the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook: Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, Goblins, Halflings, and Humans. Additionally to celebrate the announcement of the ORC license Orc ancestry templates are also available.</p><h2 class=\"stylish\">Stepwise Instructions</h2><div style=\"width:90%;margin:0 auto\"><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 1.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Ancestry Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, a prompt will pop up asking which heritage you would like to apply to your NPC. The prompt will present a dropdown with the list of included heritages for that ancestry. If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC. To ensure there were an acceptable number of heritages available for each ancestry, additional heritages were invented that were inspired by a level 1 ancestry feat from that ancestry. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Credits & License","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h2 class=\"stylish\">Credits</h2><div style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-top:0.5em\"><p><strong>Authorship</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Game Design </strong>- Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>- Amanda</p><p><strong>Beta Testing </strong>- InfamousSky &amp; SkepticRobot</p><p><strong>The PF2e Foundry Team &amp; Discord Community</strong> - without the tireless efforts of which none of this could exist.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew. You can accomplish this  by creating a Crew with less Crew Abilities than usual. </p><p><strong>Crews with Descriptive Templates -</strong> The math for Crews has been constructed to scale with the Base Creature's level. If you wish to apply a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}, you should apply it first, before applying the Crew template, to ensure the Crew template functions as intended.</p><p><em><strong>Caution</strong></em> - Stacking Crew and Descriptive templates may produce results that are more or less powerful than expected based on the listed level adjustments.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Lore Justification</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Why are Crews, groups of 4 to 6 individuals, affected by magic and other effects as if they are a single creature? While I can certainly provide a number of mechanical and balance reasons, I believe that a satisfying answer needs to make sense within the world.</p><p>The default lore for how Crews work is sympathetic magic. By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew. I've got several possible explanations for the underlying cause of this sympathetic magic; feel free to pick your favourite for your world, include different explanations for different Crews, or invent your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual -</strong> The crew has undergone a ritual blending of blood, sharing of tattoos, or similar process which binds them together for good or for ill. This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression. Hopefully you'll find it as satisfying in play as I do.</p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted. In a campaign where you are making extensive use of Crews you will want to reward the party with loot from other sources, for example, story rewards or loot from bosses.  While you can add additional copies of each item carried by the Crew to more accurately represent all the arms and armour carried by the crew, doing so results in the party receiving a lot of low level gear that is, in my experience, not worth tracking.</p><p>As is typical for the NPCs presented in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, Crews are presented with the bare minimum for gear, based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing solely on fundamental rune progression. When adapting these Crews for use in your games as adversaries, you may wish to equip your Crews with additional consumables that are narratively appropriate. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Descriptive Templates","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Personality</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a collection of templates that allow you to modify your NPCs based on a descriptive adjective.

Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the Descriptive Templates will require small adjustments that could not be automated. If the NPC's maximum HP has increased after the application of the template, you will need to adjust their current HP to match their new maximum. If your base creature has non-strike effects or abilities that deal damage, the damage of these abilities will need to be manually adjusted according to the instructions on each template. This is also an opportune time to review your chosen template for other required manual adjustments. If you have selected one of the level -2 templates you may need to adjust the creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p>Additionally, while you're reviewing your template, take note of any effects listed under the \"effect\" heading on the template, as these will need to be manually adjudicated during play.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to have particular evocative quirks, some of which may be positive and others detrimental.

the majority of any campaign.</p><p>Melee characters are listed with a range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p>Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party. If you are looking to challenge a high level party with generic underlings, either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.LVylAkC1NWnXxLul]{Troops} may be more suitable while maintaining a stronger sense of progression. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These NPCs have been designed to emulate player classes, although in many cases abilities have been simplified, condensed or reflavoured to make the NPCs easier to run for GMs. To appropriately capture the flavour of their respective classes, these NPCs with Class tend to have more abilities, than the other NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, making them more complex to run. These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon or upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. The NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental rules (+x potency rules, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">These NPCs are designed to have lower complexity than the NPCs with Classes and are particularly appropriate for use as supporting characters. For major named antagonists it may be beneficial to select one to two feats from an appropriate class, ancestry or skill to expand upon their versatility and make for a more complex villain. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">For higher level threats, the intention is that individual NPCs of this sort stop being a threat to the party, and you need to transition to using @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews}. I've intentionally not created any NPCs with jobs over level 12 to explicitly encourage this transition.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>In making these NPCs I have split them into seven different combat roles. Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

Given that inline rolls are the primary sort of damage roll used for troops, each troop is presented at a single level only rather than a level range. I don't recommend trying to modify your troops with the Weak and Elite adjustments unless you're prepared to make a number of manual adjustments.</p><p>Troops have been presented as Gargantuan creatures to reflect the rules, however, if you wish to have troops that can alter their shape per the rules in Form Up, you will wish to adjust the size to medium and place 16 medium tokens all linked to the initial imported actor. This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks. For troops that mostly rely on ranged damage or spellcasting, this adjustment is unnecessary. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Troop Creation Guidelines</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Full version of Mercenary Marketplace contains guidelines for creating your own troops.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>I find the weakness of Paizo's troops to Area Effect spells to be very unsatisfying, the weakness has the same effect whether you spend a first level burning hands spell or a 10th level meteor swarm. Whereas I feel that a higher level area effect spell used on a troop should produce a proportionately greater effect. My solution to address this grip was is to replace the weakness with a Area Effect Vulnerability, which decreases the degree of success for troops against area effect spells, thus making their effectiveness naturally scale with the power of the spell. If you find you'd prefer the standard troop weaknesses, remove the Troop Area Effect Vulnerability and give the troop a weakness with a value equal to double its listed weakness to splash damage.</p><p>Wherever possible I've chosen to create abilities for these troops that reflect the fantasy evoked by the troop's name.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Ancestry Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, a prompt will pop up asking which heritage you would like to apply to your NPC. The prompt will present a dropdown with the list of included heritages for that ancestry. If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC. To ensure there were an acceptable number of heritages available for each ancestry, additional heritages were invented that were inspired by a level 1 ancestry feat from that ancestry. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Credits & License","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h2 class=\"stylish\">Credits</h2><div style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-top:0.5em\"><p><strong>Authorship</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Game Design </strong>- Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>- Amanda</p><p><strong>Beta Testing </strong>- InfamousSky &amp; SkepticRobot</p><p><strong>The PF2e Foundry Team &amp; Discord Community</strong> - without the tireless efforts of which none of this could exist.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew. You can accomplish this  by creating a Crew with less Crew Abilities than usual. </p><p><strong>Crews with Descriptive Templates -</strong> The math for Crews has been constructed to scale with the Base Creature's level. If you wish to apply a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}, you should apply it first, before applying the Crew template, to ensure the Crew template functions as intended.</p><p><em><strong>Caution</strong></em> - Stacking Crew and Descriptive templates may produce results that are more or less powerful than expected based on the listed level adjustments.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Lore Justification</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Why are Crews, groups of 4 to 6 individuals, affected by magic and other effects as if they are a single creature? While I can certainly provide a number of mechanical and balance reasons, I believe that a satisfying answer needs to make sense within the world.</p><p>The default lore for how Crews work is sympathetic magic. By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew. I've got several possible explanations for the underlying cause of this sympathetic magic; feel free to pick your favourite for your world, include different explanations for different Crews, or invent your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual -</strong> The crew has undergone a ritual blending of blood, sharing of tattoos, or similar process which binds them together for good or for ill. This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression. Hopefully you'll find it as satisfying in play as I do.</p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted. In a campaign where you are making extensive use of Crews you will want to reward the party with loot from other sources, for example, story rewards or loot from bosses.  While you can add additional copies of each item carried by the Crew to more accurately represent all the arms and armour carried by the crew, doing so results in the party receiving a lot of low level gear that is, in my experience, not worth tracking.</p><p>As is typical for the NPCs presented in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, Crews are presented with the bare minimum for gear, based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing solely on fundamental rune progression.

Many of these templates will also increase or decrease the level of the creature.</p><h2 class=\"stylish\">Instructions</h2><div style=\"width:90%;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:3.5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 1.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Descriptive Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet, of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet the Template will automatically apply any appropriate bonuses or penalties and grant any new abilities using the grant item rule element to the NPC. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 3. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the Descriptive Templates will require small adjustments that could not be automated. If the NPC's maximum HP has increased after the application of the template, you will need to adjust their current HP to match their new maximum. If your base creature has non-strike effects or abilities that deal damage, the damage of these abilities will need to be manually adjusted according to the instructions on each template. This is also an opportune time to review your chosen template for other required manual adjustments. If you have selected one of the level -2 templates you may need to adjust the creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p>Additionally, while you're reviewing your template, take note of any effects listed under the \"effect\" heading on the template, as these will need to be manually adjudicated during play.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to have particular evocative quirks, some of which may be positive and others detrimental.

the majority of any campaign.</p><p>Melee characters are listed with a range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p>Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party. If you are looking to challenge a high level party with generic underlings, either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.LVylAkC1NWnXxLul]{Troops} may be more suitable while maintaining a stronger sense of progression. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These NPCs have been designed to emulate player classes, although in many cases abilities have been simplified, condensed or reflavoured to make the NPCs easier to run for GMs. To appropriately capture the flavour of their respective classes, these NPCs with Class tend to have more abilities, than the other NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, making them more complex to run. These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon or upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. The NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental rules (+x potency rules, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">These NPCs are designed to have lower complexity than the NPCs with Classes and are particularly appropriate for use as supporting characters. For major named antagonists it may be beneficial to select one to two feats from an appropriate class, ancestry or skill to expand upon their versatility and make for a more complex villain. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">For higher level threats, the intention is that individual NPCs of this sort stop being a threat to the party, and you need to transition to using @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews}. I've intentionally not created any NPCs with jobs over level 12 to explicitly encourage this transition.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>In making these NPCs I have split them into seven different combat roles. Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

I don't recommend trying to modify your troops with the Weak and Elite adjustments unless you're prepared to make a number of manual adjustments.</p><p>Troops have been presented as Gargantuan creatures to reflect the rules, however, if you wish to have troops that can alter their shape per the rules in Form Up, you will wish to adjust the size to medium and place 16 medium tokens all linked to the initial imported actor. This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks.

My solution to address this grip was is to replace the weakness with a Area Effect Vulnerability, which decreases the degree of success for troops against area effect spells, thus making their effectiveness naturally scale with the power of the spell. If you find you'd prefer the standard troop weaknesses, remove the Troop Area Effect Vulnerability and give the troop a weakness with a value equal to double its listed weakness to splash damage.</p><p>Wherever possible I've chosen to create abilities for these troops that reflect the fantasy evoked by the troop's name.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Ancestry Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, a prompt will pop up asking which heritage you would like to apply to your NPC. The prompt will present a dropdown with the list of included heritages for that ancestry. If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC. To ensure there were an acceptable number of heritages available for each ancestry, additional heritages were invented that were inspired by a level 1 ancestry feat from that ancestry. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Credits & License","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h2 class=\"stylish\">Credits</h2><div style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-top:0.5em\"><p><strong>Authorship</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Game Design </strong>- Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>- Amanda</p><p><strong>Beta Testing </strong>- InfamousSky &amp; SkepticRobot</p><p><strong>The PF2e Foundry Team &amp; Discord Community</strong> - without the tireless efforts of which none of this could exist.

Any creature with the Crew trait is treated as a single creature for the purposes of spells and effects. However, it may be selected twice for abilities that require you to select two adjacent creatures, such as swipe.</p><p>Below you will find a description of how to use the templates in the full of the module.</p><h2 class=\"stylish\">Instructions</h2><div style=\"width:90%;margin:0 auto\"><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 1. Select Template</h3><p>Select a Crew Template. There are two Crew Templates provided.</p><p>The <strong>Ragtag Crew Template</strong> which produces a Crew with a level 2-higher than that of the base creature.</p><p>The <strong>Crew Template</strong> which produces a Crew with a level 4-higher than that of the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 2. Select Abilities</h3><p>Select Crew Abilities from the table below for your Crew. Select 1 ability if you are creating a Ragtag Crew or 2 if you are creating a standard Crew.</p><p>These abilities represent special training or capabilities the Crew has developed as a group. The abilities have been divided into Universal Abilities that are useful to all Crews, and Spellcaster Exclusive Abilities that are only useful if the base creature is a spellcaster.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew. You can accomplish this  by creating a Crew with less Crew Abilities than usual. </p><p><strong>Crews with Descriptive Templates -</strong> The math for Crews has been constructed to scale with the Base Creature's level. If you wish to apply a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}, you should apply it first, before applying the Crew template, to ensure the Crew template functions as intended.</p><p><em><strong>Caution</strong></em> - Stacking Crew and Descriptive templates may produce results that are more or less powerful than expected based on the listed level adjustments.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Lore Justification</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Why are Crews, groups of 4 to 6 individuals, affected by magic and other effects as if they are a single creature? While I can certainly provide a number of mechanical and balance reasons, I believe that a satisfying answer needs to make sense within the world.</p><p>The default lore for how Crews work is sympathetic magic. By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew. I've got several possible explanations for the underlying cause of this sympathetic magic; feel free to pick your favourite for your world, include different explanations for different Crews, or invent your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual -</strong> The crew has undergone a ritual blending of blood, sharing of tattoos, or similar process which binds them together for good or for ill. This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression. Hopefully you'll find it as satisfying in play as I do.</p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted. In a campaign where you are making extensive use of Crews you will want to reward the party with loot from other sources, for example, story rewards or loot from bosses.  While you can add additional copies of each item carried by the Crew to more accurately represent all the arms and armour carried by the crew, doing so results in the party receiving a lot of low level gear that is, in my experience, not worth tracking.</p><p>As is typical for the NPCs presented in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, Crews are presented with the bare minimum for gear, based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing solely on fundamental rune progression. When adapting these Crews for use in your games as adversaries, you may wish to equip your Crews with additional consumables that are narratively appropriate. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Descriptive Templates","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Personality</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a collection of templates that allow you to modify your NPCs based on a descriptive adjective.

You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party. If you are looking to challenge a high level party with generic underlings, either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.LVylAkC1NWnXxLul]{Troops} may be more suitable while maintaining a stronger sense of progression. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These NPCs have been designed to emulate player classes, although in many cases abilities have been simplified, condensed or reflavoured to make the NPCs easier to run for GMs. To appropriately capture the flavour of their respective classes, these NPCs with Class tend to have more abilities, than the other NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, making them more complex to run. These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Ancestry Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, a prompt will pop up asking which heritage you would like to apply to your NPC. The prompt will present a dropdown with the list of included heritages for that ancestry. If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC. To ensure there were an acceptable number of heritages available for each ancestry, additional heritages were invented that were inspired by a level 1 ancestry feat from that ancestry. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Credits & License","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h2 class=\"stylish\">Credits</h2><div style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-top:0.5em\"><p><strong>Authorship</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Game Design </strong>- Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>- Amanda</p><p><strong>Beta Testing </strong>- InfamousSky &amp; SkepticRobot</p><p><strong>The PF2e Foundry Team &amp; Discord Community</strong> - without the tireless efforts of which none of this could exist.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew. You can accomplish this  by creating a Crew with less Crew Abilities than usual. </p><p><strong>Crews with Descriptive Templates -</strong> The math for Crews has been constructed to scale with the Base Creature's level. If you wish to apply a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}, you should apply it first, before applying the Crew template, to ensure the Crew template functions as intended.</p><p><em><strong>Caution</strong></em> - Stacking Crew and Descriptive templates may produce results that are more or less powerful than expected based on the listed level adjustments.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Lore Justification</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Why are Crews, groups of 4 to 6 individuals, affected by magic and other effects as if they are a single creature? While I can certainly provide a number of mechanical and balance reasons, I believe that a satisfying answer needs to make sense within the world.</p><p>The default lore for how Crews work is sympathetic magic. By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew. I've got several possible explanations for the underlying cause of this sympathetic magic; feel free to pick your favourite for your world, include different explanations for different Crews, or invent your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual -</strong> The crew has undergone a ritual blending of blood, sharing of tattoos, or similar process which binds them together for good or for ill. This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression. Hopefully you'll find it as satisfying in play as I do.</p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted. In a campaign where you are making extensive use of Crews you will want to reward the party with loot from other sources, for example, story rewards or loot from bosses.  While you can add additional copies of each item carried by the Crew to more accurately represent all the arms and armour carried by the crew, doing so results in the party receiving a lot of low level gear that is, in my experience, not worth tracking.</p><p>As is typical for the NPCs presented in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, Crews are presented with the bare minimum for gear, based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing solely on fundamental rune progression. When adapting these Crews for use in your games as adversaries, you may wish to equip your Crews with additional consumables that are narratively appropriate. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Descriptive Templates","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Personality</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a collection of templates that allow you to modify your NPCs based on a descriptive adjective.

Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the Descriptive Templates will require small adjustments that could not be automated. If the NPC's maximum HP has increased after the application of the template, you will need to adjust their current HP to match their new maximum. If your base creature has non-strike effects or abilities that deal damage, the damage of these abilities will need to be manually adjusted according to the instructions on each template. This is also an opportune time to review your chosen template for other required manual adjustments.

the majority of any campaign.</p><p>Melee characters are listed with a range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p>Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party. If you are looking to challenge a high level party with generic underlings, either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.LVylAkC1NWnXxLul]{Troops} may be more suitable while maintaining a stronger sense of progression. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These NPCs have been designed to emulate player classes, although in many cases abilities have been simplified, condensed or reflavoured to make the NPCs easier to run for GMs. To appropriately capture the flavour of their respective classes, these NPCs with Class tend to have more abilities, than the other NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, making them more complex to run. These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon or upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. The NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental rules (+x potency rules, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">These NPCs are designed to have lower complexity than the NPCs with Classes and are particularly appropriate for use as supporting characters. For major named antagonists it may be beneficial to select one to two feats from an appropriate class, ancestry or skill to expand upon their versatility and make for a more complex villain. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">For higher level threats, the intention is that individual NPCs of this sort stop being a threat to the party, and you need to transition to using @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews}. I've intentionally not created any NPCs with jobs over level 12 to explicitly encourage this transition.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>In making these NPCs I have split them into seven different combat roles. Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

Given that inline rolls are the primary sort of damage roll used for troops, each troop is presented at a single level only rather than a level range. I don't recommend trying to modify your troops with the Weak and Elite adjustments unless you're prepared to make a number of manual adjustments.</p><p>Troops have been presented as Gargantuan creatures to reflect the rules, however, if you wish to have troops that can alter their shape per the rules in Form Up, you will wish to adjust the size to medium and place 16 medium tokens all linked to the initial imported actor. This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks. For troops that mostly rely on ranged damage or spellcasting, this adjustment is unnecessary. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Troop Creation Guidelines</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Full version of Mercenary Marketplace contains guidelines for creating your own troops.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>I find the weakness of Paizo's troops to Area Effect spells to be very unsatisfying, the weakness has the same effect whether you spend a first level burning hands spell or a 10th level meteor swarm. Whereas I feel that a higher level area effect spell used on a troop should produce a proportionately greater effect. My solution to address this grip was is to replace the weakness with a Area Effect Vulnerability, which decreases the degree of success for troops against area effect spells, thus making their effectiveness naturally scale with the power of the spell. If you find you'd prefer the standard troop weaknesses, remove the Troop Area Effect Vulnerability and give the troop a weakness with a value equal to double its listed weakness to splash damage.</p><p>Wherever possible I've chosen to create abilities for these troops that reflect the fantasy evoked by the troop's name.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Ancestry Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, a prompt will pop up asking which heritage you would like to apply to your NPC. The prompt will present a dropdown with the list of included heritages for that ancestry. If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC. To ensure there were an acceptable number of heritages available for each ancestry, additional heritages were invented that were inspired by a level 1 ancestry feat from that ancestry. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Credits & License","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h2 class=\"stylish\">Credits</h2><div style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-top:0.5em\"><p><strong>Authorship</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Game Design </strong>- Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>- Amanda</p><p><strong>Beta Testing </strong>- InfamousSky &amp; SkepticRobot</p><p><strong>The PF2e Foundry Team &amp; Discord Community</strong> - without the tireless efforts of which none of this could exist.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew. You can accomplish this  by creating a Crew with less Crew Abilities than usual. </p><p><strong>Crews with Descriptive Templates -</strong> The math for Crews has been constructed to scale with the Base Creature's level. If you wish to apply a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}, you should apply it first, before applying the Crew template, to ensure the Crew template functions as intended.</p><p><em><strong>Caution</strong></em> - Stacking Crew and Descriptive templates may produce results that are more or less powerful than expected based on the listed level adjustments.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Lore Justification</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Why are Crews, groups of 4 to 6 individuals, affected by magic and other effects as if they are a single creature? While I can certainly provide a number of mechanical and balance reasons, I believe that a satisfying answer needs to make sense within the world.</p><p>The default lore for how Crews work is sympathetic magic. By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew. I've got several possible explanations for the underlying cause of this sympathetic magic; feel free to pick your favourite for your world, include different explanations for different Crews, or invent your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual -</strong> The crew has undergone a ritual blending of blood, sharing of tattoos, or similar process which binds them together for good or for ill. This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression. Hopefully you'll find it as satisfying in play as I do.</p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted. In a campaign where you are making extensive use of Crews you will want to reward the party with loot from other sources, for example, story rewards or loot from bosses.  While you can add additional copies of each item carried by the Crew to more accurately represent all the arms and armour carried by the crew, doing so results in the party receiving a lot of low level gear that is, in my experience, not worth tracking.</p><p>As is typical for the NPCs presented in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, Crews are presented with the bare minimum for gear, based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing solely on fundamental rune progression.

Many of these templates will also increase or decrease the level of the creature.</p><h2 class=\"stylish\">Instructions</h2><div style=\"width:90%;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:3.5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 1.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Descriptive Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet, of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet the Template will automatically apply any appropriate bonuses or penalties and grant any new abilities using the grant item rule element to the NPC. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 3. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the Descriptive Templates will require small adjustments that could not be automated. If the NPC's maximum HP has increased after the application of the template, you will need to adjust their current HP to match their new maximum. If your base creature has non-strike effects or abilities that deal damage, the damage of these abilities will need to be manually adjusted according to the instructions on each template. This is also an opportune time to review your chosen template for other required manual adjustments. If you have selected one of the level -2 templates you may need to adjust the creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p>Additionally, while you're reviewing your template, take note of any effects listed under the \"effect\" heading on the template, as these will need to be manually adjudicated during play.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to have particular evocative quirks, some of which may be positive and others detrimental.

the majority of any campaign.</p><p>Melee characters are listed with a range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p>Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party. If you are looking to challenge a high level party with generic underlings, either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.LVylAkC1NWnXxLul]{Troops} may be more suitable while maintaining a stronger sense of progression. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These NPCs have been designed to emulate player classes, although in many cases abilities have been simplified, condensed or reflavoured to make the NPCs easier to run for GMs. To appropriately capture the flavour of their respective classes, these NPCs with Class tend to have more abilities, than the other NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, making them more complex to run. These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon or upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. The NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental rules (+x potency rules, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">These NPCs are designed to have lower complexity than the NPCs with Classes and are particularly appropriate for use as supporting characters. For major named antagonists it may be beneficial to select one to two feats from an appropriate class, ancestry or skill to expand upon their versatility and make for a more complex villain. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">For higher level threats, the intention is that individual NPCs of this sort stop being a threat to the party, and you need to transition to using @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews}. I've intentionally not created any NPCs with jobs over level 12 to explicitly encourage this transition.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>In making these NPCs I have split them into seven different combat roles. Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

Given that inline rolls are the primary sort of damage roll used for troops, each troop is presented at a single level only rather than a level range. I don't recommend trying to modify your troops with the Weak and Elite adjustments unless you're prepared to make a number of manual adjustments.</p><p>Troops have been presented as Gargantuan creatures to reflect the rules, however, if you wish to have troops that can alter their shape per the rules in Form Up, you will wish to adjust the size to medium and place 16 medium tokens all linked to the initial imported actor. This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks.

My solution to address this grip was is to replace the weakness with a Area Effect Vulnerability, which decreases the degree of success for troops against area effect spells, thus making their effectiveness naturally scale with the power of the spell. If you find you'd prefer the standard troop weaknesses, remove the Troop Area Effect Vulnerability and give the troop a weakness with a value equal to double its listed weakness to splash damage.</p><p>Wherever possible I've chosen to create abilities for these troops that reflect the fantasy evoked by the troop's name.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Ancestry Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, a prompt will pop up asking which heritage you would like to apply to your NPC. The prompt will present a dropdown with the list of included heritages for that ancestry. If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC. To ensure there were an acceptable number of heritages available for each ancestry, additional heritages were invented that were inspired by a level 1 ancestry feat from that ancestry. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Credits & License","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h2 class=\"stylish\">Credits</h2><div style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-top:0.5em\"><p><strong>Authorship</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Game Design </strong>- Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>- Amanda</p><p><strong>Beta Testing </strong>- InfamousSky &amp; SkepticRobot</p><p><strong>The PF2e Foundry Team &amp; Discord Community</strong> - without the tireless efforts of which none of this could exist.

Any creature with the Crew trait is treated as a single creature for the purposes of spells and effects. However, it may be selected twice for abilities that require you to select two adjacent creatures, such as swipe.</p><p>Below you will find a description of how to use the templates in the full of the module.</p><h2 class=\"stylish\">Instructions</h2><div style=\"width:90%;margin:0 auto\"><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 1. Select Template</h3><p>Select a Crew Template. There are two Crew Templates provided.</p><p>The <strong>Ragtag Crew Template</strong> which produces a Crew with a level 2-higher than that of the base creature.</p><p>The <strong>Crew Template</strong> which produces a Crew with a level 4-higher than that of the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 2. Select Abilities</h3><p>Select Crew Abilities from the table below for your Crew. Select 1 ability if you are creating a Ragtag Crew or 2 if you are creating a standard Crew.</p><p>These abilities represent special training or capabilities the Crew has developed as a group. The abilities have been divided into Universal Abilities that are useful to all Crews, and Spellcaster Exclusive Abilities that are only useful if the base creature is a spellcaster.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew. You can accomplish this  by creating a Crew with less Crew Abilities than usual. </p><p><strong>Crews with Descriptive Templates -</strong> The math for Crews has been constructed to scale with the Base Creature's level. If you wish to apply a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}, you should apply it first, before applying the Crew template, to ensure the Crew template functions as intended.</p><p><em><strong>Caution</strong></em> - Stacking Crew and Descriptive templates may produce results that are more or less powerful than expected based on the listed level adjustments.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Lore Justification</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Why are Crews, groups of 4 to 6 individuals, affected by magic and other effects as if they are a single creature? While I can certainly provide a number of mechanical and balance reasons, I believe that a satisfying answer needs to make sense within the world.</p><p>The default lore for how Crews work is sympathetic magic. By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew. I've got several possible explanations for the underlying cause of this sympathetic magic; feel free to pick your favourite for your world, include different explanations for different Crews, or invent your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual -</strong> The crew has undergone a ritual blending of blood, sharing of tattoos, or similar process which binds them together for good or for ill. This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression. Hopefully you'll find it as satisfying in play as I do.</p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted. In a campaign where you are making extensive use of Crews you will want to reward the party with loot from other sources, for example, story rewards or loot from bosses.  While you can add additional copies of each item carried by the Crew to more accurately represent all the arms and armour carried by the crew, doing so results in the party receiving a lot of low level gear that is, in my experience, not worth tracking.</p><p>As is typical for the NPCs presented in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, Crews are presented with the bare minimum for gear, based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing solely on fundamental rune progression. When adapting these Crews for use in your games as adversaries, you may wish to equip your Crews with additional consumables that are narratively appropriate. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Descriptive Templates","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Personality</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a collection of templates that allow you to modify your NPCs based on a descriptive adjective.

You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party. If you are looking to challenge a high level party with generic underlings, either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.LVylAkC1NWnXxLul]{Troops} may be more suitable while maintaining a stronger sense of progression. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These NPCs have been designed to emulate player classes, although in many cases abilities have been simplified, condensed or reflavoured to make the NPCs easier to run for GMs. To appropriately capture the flavour of their respective classes, these NPCs with Class tend to have more abilities, than the other NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, making them more complex to run. These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks. For troops that mostly rely on ranged damage or spellcasting, this adjustment is unnecessary. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Troop Creation Guidelines</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Full version of Mercenary Marketplace contains guidelines for creating your own troops.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>I find the weakness of Paizo's troops to Area Effect spells to be very unsatisfying, the weakness has the same effect whether you spend a first level burning hands spell or a 10th level meteor swarm.

My solution to address this grip was is to replace the weakness with a Area Effect Vulnerability, which decreases the degree of success for troops against area effect spells, thus making their effectiveness naturally scale with the power of the spell.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Ancestry Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, a prompt will pop up asking which heritage you would like to apply to your NPC. The prompt will present a dropdown with the list of included heritages for that ancestry. If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding: 0; margin: 0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding: 0; margin: 0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding: 0; margin: 0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding: 0; margin: 0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding: 0; margin: 0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding: 0; margin: 0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC. To ensure there were an acceptable number of heritages available for each ancestry, additional heritages were invented that were inspired by a level 1 ancestry feat from that ancestry. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Credits & License","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h2 class=\"stylish\">Credits</h2><div style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-top:0.5em\"><p><strong>Authorship</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Game Design </strong>- Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>- Amanda</p><p><strong>Beta Testing </strong>- InfamousSky &amp; SkepticRobot</p><p><strong>The PF2e Foundry Team &amp; Discord Community</strong> - without the tireless efforts of which none of this could exist.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew. You can accomplish this  by creating a Crew with less Crew Abilities than usual. </p><p><strong>Crews with Descriptive Templates -</strong> The math for Crews has been constructed to scale with the Base Creature's level. If you wish to apply a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}, you should apply it first, before applying the Crew template, to ensure the Crew template functions as intended.</p><p><em><strong>Caution</strong></em> - Stacking Crew and Descriptive templates may produce results that are more or less powerful than expected based on the listed level adjustments.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Lore Justification</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Why are Crews, groups of 4 to 6 individuals, affected by magic and other effects as if they are a single creature? While I can certainly provide a number of mechanical and balance reasons, I believe that a satisfying answer needs to make sense within the world.</p><p>The default lore for how Crews work is sympathetic magic. By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew. I've got several possible explanations for the underlying cause of this sympathetic magic; feel free to pick your favourite for your world, include different explanations for different Crews, or invent your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual -</strong> The crew has undergone a ritual blending of blood, sharing of tattoos, or similar process which binds them together for good or for ill. This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression. Hopefully you'll find it as satisfying in play as I do.</p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted. In a campaign where you are making extensive use of Crews you will want to reward the party with loot from other sources, for example, story rewards or loot from bosses.  While you can add additional copies of each item carried by the Crew to more accurately represent all the arms and armour carried by the crew, doing so results in the party receiving a lot of low level gear that is, in my experience, not worth tracking.</p><p>As is typical for the NPCs presented in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, Crews are presented with the bare minimum for gear, based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing solely on fundamental rune progression. When adapting these Crews for use in your games as adversaries, you may wish to equip your Crews with additional consumables that are narratively appropriate. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Descriptive Templates","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Personality</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a collection of templates that allow you to modify your NPCs based on a descriptive adjective.

Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the Descriptive Templates will require small adjustments that could not be automated. If the NPC's maximum HP has increased after the application of the template, you will need to adjust their current HP to match their new maximum. If your base creature has non-strike effects or abilities that deal damage, the damage of these abilities will need to be manually adjusted according to the instructions on each template. This is also an opportune time to review your chosen template for other required manual adjustments.

the majority of any campaign.</p><p>Melee characters are listed with a range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p>Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party. If you are looking to challenge a high level party with generic underlings, either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.LVylAkC1NWnXxLul]{Troops} may be more suitable while maintaining a stronger sense of progression. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These NPCs have been designed to emulate player classes, although in many cases abilities have been simplified, condensed or reflavoured to make the NPCs easier to run for GMs. To appropriately capture the flavour of their respective classes, these NPCs with Class tend to have more abilities, than the other NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, making them more complex to run. These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon or upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. The NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental rules (+x potency rules, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">These NPCs are designed to have lower complexity than the NPCs with Classes and are particularly appropriate for use as supporting characters. For major named antagonists it may be beneficial to select one to two feats from an appropriate class, ancestry or skill to expand upon their versatility and make for a more complex villain. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">For higher level threats, the intention is that individual NPCs of this sort stop being a threat to the party, and you need to transition to using @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews}. I've intentionally not created any NPCs with jobs over level 12 to explicitly encourage this transition.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>In making these NPCs I have split them into seven different combat roles. Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

Given that inline rolls are the primary sort of damage roll used for troops, each troop is presented at a single level only rather than a level range. I don't recommend trying to modify your troops with the Weak and Elite adjustments unless you're prepared to make a number of manual adjustments.</p><p>Troops have been presented as Gargantuan creatures to reflect the rules, however, if you wish to have troops that can alter their shape per the rules in Form Up, you will wish to adjust the size to medium and place 16 medium tokens all linked to the initial imported actor. This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks. For troops that mostly rely on ranged damage or spellcasting, this adjustment is unnecessary. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Troop Creation Guidelines</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Full version of Mercenary Marketplace contains guidelines for creating your own troops.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>I find the weakness of Paizo's troops to Area Effect spells to be very unsatisfying, the weakness has the same effect whether you spend a first level burning hands spell or a 10th level meteor swarm. Whereas I feel that a higher level area effect spell used on a troop should produce a proportionately greater effect. My solution to address this grip was is to replace the weakness with a Area Effect Vulnerability, which decreases the degree of success for troops against area effect spells, thus making their effectiveness naturally scale with the power of the spell. If you find you'd prefer the standard troop weaknesses, remove the Troop Area Effect Vulnerability and give the troop a weakness with a value equal to double its listed weakness to splash damage.</p><p>Wherever possible I've chosen to create abilities for these troops that reflect the fantasy evoked by the troop's name.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Ancestry Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, a prompt will pop up asking which heritage you would like to apply to your NPC. The prompt will present a dropdown with the list of included heritages for that ancestry. If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC. To ensure there were an acceptable number of heritages available for each ancestry, additional heritages were invented that were inspired by a level 1 ancestry feat from that ancestry. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Credits & License","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h2 class=\"stylish\">Credits</h2><div style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-top:0.5em\"><p><strong>Authorship</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Game Design </strong>- Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>- Amanda</p><p><strong>Beta Testing </strong>- InfamousSky &amp; SkepticRobot</p><p><strong>The PF2e Foundry Team &amp; Discord Community</strong> - without the tireless efforts of which none of this could exist.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew. You can accomplish this  by creating a Crew with less Crew Abilities than usual. </p><p><strong>Crews with Descriptive Templates -</strong> The math for Crews has been constructed to scale with the Base Creature's level. If you wish to apply a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}, you should apply it first, before applying the Crew template, to ensure the Crew template functions as intended.</p><p><em><strong>Caution</strong></em> - Stacking Crew and Descriptive templates may produce results that are more or less powerful than expected based on the listed level adjustments.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Lore Justification</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Why are Crews, groups of 4 to 6 individuals, affected by magic and other effects as if they are a single creature? While I can certainly provide a number of mechanical and balance reasons, I believe that a satisfying answer needs to make sense within the world.</p><p>The default lore for how Crews work is sympathetic magic. By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew. I've got several possible explanations for the underlying cause of this sympathetic magic; feel free to pick your favourite for your world, include different explanations for different Crews, or invent your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual -</strong> The crew has undergone a ritual blending of blood, sharing of tattoos, or similar process which binds them together for good or for ill. This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression. Hopefully you'll find it as satisfying in play as I do.</p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted. In a campaign where you are making extensive use of Crews you will want to reward the party with loot from other sources, for example, story rewards or loot from bosses.  While you can add additional copies of each item carried by the Crew to more accurately represent all the arms and armour carried by the crew, doing so results in the party receiving a lot of low level gear that is, in my experience, not worth tracking.</p><p>As is typical for the NPCs presented in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, Crews are presented with the bare minimum for gear, based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing solely on fundamental rune progression. When adapting these Crews for use in your games as adversaries, you may wish to equip your Crews with additional consumables that are narratively appropriate. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Descriptive Templates","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Personality</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a collection of templates that allow you to modify your NPCs based on a descriptive adjective.

Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the Descriptive Templates will require small adjustments that could not be automated. If the NPC's maximum HP has increased after the application of the template, you will need to adjust their current HP to match their new maximum. If your base creature has non-strike effects or abilities that deal damage, the damage of these abilities will need to be manually adjusted according to the instructions on each template. This is also an opportune time to review your chosen template for other required manual adjustments.

the majority of any campaign.</p><p>Melee characters are listed with a range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p>Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party. If you are looking to challenge a high level party with generic underlings, either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.LVylAkC1NWnXxLul]{Troops} may be more suitable while maintaining a stronger sense of progression. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These NPCs have been designed to emulate player classes, although in many cases abilities have been simplified, condensed or reflavoured to make the NPCs easier to run for GMs. To appropriately capture the flavour of their respective classes, these NPCs with Class tend to have more abilities, than the other NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, making them more complex to run. These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon or upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. The NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental rules (+x potency rules, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">These NPCs are designed to have lower complexity than the NPCs with Classes and are particularly appropriate for use as supporting characters. For major named antagonists it may be beneficial to select one to two feats from an appropriate class, ancestry or skill to expand upon their versatility and make for a more complex villain. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">For higher level threats, the intention is that individual NPCs of this sort stop being a threat to the party, and you need to transition to using @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews}. I've intentionally not created any NPCs with jobs over level 12 to explicitly encourage this transition.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>In making these NPCs I have split them into seven different combat roles. Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

Given that inline rolls are the primary sort of damage roll used for troops, each troop is presented at a single level only rather than a level range. I don't recommend trying to modify your troops with the Weak and Elite adjustments unless you're prepared to make a number of manual adjustments.</p><p>Troops have been presented as Gargantuan creatures to reflect the rules, however, if you wish to have troops that can alter their shape per the rules in Form Up, you will wish to adjust the size to medium and place 16 medium tokens all linked to the initial imported actor. This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks. For troops that mostly rely on ranged damage or spellcasting, this adjustment is unnecessary. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Troop Creation Guidelines</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Full version of Mercenary Marketplace contains guidelines for creating your own troops.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>I find the weakness of Paizo's troops to Area Effect spells to be very unsatisfying, the weakness has the same effect whether you spend a first level burning hands spell or a 10th level meteor swarm. Whereas I feel that a higher level area effect spell used on a troop should produce a proportionately greater effect. My solution to address this grip was is to replace the weakness with a Area Effect Vulnerability, which decreases the degree of success for troops against area effect spells, thus making their effectiveness naturally scale with the power of the spell. If you find you'd prefer the standard troop weaknesses, remove the Troop Area Effect Vulnerability and give the troop a weakness with a value equal to double its listed weakness to splash damage.</p><p>Wherever possible I've chosen to create abilities for these troops that reflect the fantasy evoked by the troop's name.

If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC. To ensure there were an acceptable number of heritages available for each ancestry, additional heritages were invented that were inspired by a level 1 ancestry feat from that ancestry. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Credits & License","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h2 class=\"stylish\">Credits</h2><div style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-top:0.5em\"><p><strong>Authorship</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Game Design </strong>- Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>- Amanda</p><p><strong>Beta Testing </strong>- InfamousSky &amp; SkepticRobot</p><p><strong>The PF2e Foundry Team &amp; Discord Community</strong> - without the tireless efforts of which none of this could exist.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew.

While I can certainly provide a number of mechanical and balance reasons, I believe that a satisfying answer needs to make sense within the world.</p><p>The default lore for how Crews work is sympathetic magic. By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew. I've got several possible explanations for the underlying cause of this sympathetic magic; feel free to pick your favourite for your world, include different explanations for different Crews, or invent your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual -</strong> The crew has undergone a ritual blending of blood, sharing of tattoos, or similar process which binds them together for good or for ill. This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression. Hopefully you'll find it as satisfying in play as I do.</p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted.

You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party.

These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Ancestry Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, a prompt will pop up asking which heritage you would like to apply to your NPC. The prompt will present a dropdown with the list of included heritages for that ancestry. If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC. To ensure there were an acceptable number of heritages available for each ancestry, additional heritages were invented that were inspired by a level 1 ancestry feat from that ancestry. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Credits & License","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h2 class=\"stylish\">Credits</h2><div style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-top:0.5em\"><p><strong>Authorship</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Game Design </strong>- Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>- Amanda</p><p><strong>Beta Testing </strong>- InfamousSky &amp; SkepticRobot</p><p><strong>The PF2e Foundry Team &amp; Discord Community</strong> - without the tireless efforts of which none of this could exist.

Any creature with the Crew trait is treated as a single creature for the purposes of spells and effects. However, it may be selected twice for abilities that require you to select two adjacent creatures, such as swipe.</p><p>Below you will find a description of how to use the templates in the full of the module.</p><h2 class=\"stylish\">Instructions</h2><div style=\"width:90%;margin:0 auto\"><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 1. Select Template</h3><p>Select a Crew Template. There are two Crew Templates provided.</p><p>The <strong>Ragtag Crew Template</strong> which produces a Crew with a level 2-higher than that of the base creature.</p><p>The <strong>Crew Template</strong> which produces a Crew with a level 4-higher than that of the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 2. Select Abilities</h3><p>Select Crew Abilities from the table below for your Crew. Select 1 ability if you are creating a Ragtag Crew or 2 if you are creating a standard Crew.</p><p>These abilities represent special training or capabilities the Crew has developed as a group. The abilities have been divided into Universal Abilities that are useful to all Crews, and Spellcaster Exclusive Abilities that are only useful if the base creature is a spellcaster.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew. You can accomplish this  by creating a Crew with less Crew Abilities than usual. </p><p><strong>Crews with Descriptive Templates -</strong> The math for Crews has been constructed to scale with the Base Creature's level. If you wish to apply a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}, you should apply it first, before applying the Crew template, to ensure the Crew template functions as intended.</p><p><em><strong>Caution</strong></em> - Stacking Crew and Descriptive templates may produce results that are more or less powerful than expected based on the listed level adjustments.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Lore Justification</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Why are Crews, groups of 4 to 6 individuals, affected by magic and other effects as if they are a single creature? While I can certainly provide a number of mechanical and balance reasons, I believe that a satisfying answer needs to make sense within the world.</p><p>The default lore for how Crews work is sympathetic magic. By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew. I've got several possible explanations for the underlying cause of this sympathetic magic; feel free to pick your favourite for your world, include different explanations for different Crews, or invent your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual -</strong> The crew has undergone a ritual blending of blood, sharing of tattoos, or similar process which binds them together for good or for ill. This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression. Hopefully you'll find it as satisfying in play as I do.</p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted. In a campaign where you are making extensive use of Crews you will want to reward the party with loot from other sources, for example, story rewards or loot from bosses.  While you can add additional copies of each item carried by the Crew to more accurately represent all the arms and armour carried by the crew, doing so results in the party receiving a lot of low level gear that is, in my experience, not worth tracking.</p><p>As is typical for the NPCs presented in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, Crews are presented with the bare minimum for gear, based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing solely on fundamental rune progression.

The second can be used to quickly set up the requisite spellcasting entries for the Sorcerous NPC template, which allows you to quickly add a splash of magical power to your NPCs. </p><h2 class=\"plain\">Full Version</h2><hr /><p>If you end up loving the content of the Mercenary Marketplace Demo, then please consider supporting my work by purchasing the <a href=\"https://velara.itch.io/mercenary-marketplace-v1\">full version</a>.</p></div><div style=\"flex:0 0 1em\"><h4> </h4></div><div id=\"directory\" style=\"flex:0 1 16em;background-color:#0d253f;padding-left:1em;padding-right:1em;padding-top:1em;border:10px solid #050e18\"><div style=\"position:sticky;top:5%;width:16em\"><img style=\"border:0;margin-top:-0.3em\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/directory.png\" /><h4 class=\"directory\">NPC Catalogues</h4><hr /><div style=\"margin-left:3em;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;color:black\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.JWFJTzMI86q256tm]{NPCs with Classes}</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;color:black\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH]{NPCs with Jobs}</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;color:black\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.XAdP7FZyWoeMEfRI]{Generic Spellcasters}</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;color:black\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews}</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;color:black\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.LVylAkC1NWnXxLul]{Troops}</p></div><h4 class=\"directory\">Template Catalogues</h4><hr /><div style=\"margin-left:3em;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;color:black\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates}</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;color:black\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates}</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;color:black\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}</p></div><h4 class=\"directory\">Other Links</h4><hr /><div style=\"margin-left:3em;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;color:black\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ysvcY0zFgA6pn1Ak]{New Rules}</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;color:black\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.62pBbzbgeMFzOeHD]{Macros}</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;color:black\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.2h7OGxE2sIBY8h2k]{Credits &amp; License}</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><a style=\"color:floralwhite\" href=\"https://github.com/velara/MercenaryMarketVolume1/issues\">GitHub Issues Tracker</a></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><a style=\"color:floralwhite\" href=\"https://github.com/velara/MercenaryMarketplaceVolume1/releases\">Release Notes</a></p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><a style=\"color:floralwhite\" href=\"https://www.patreon.com/MercenaryMarketplace\">Patreon</a></p></div></div></div></div><p style=\"color:floralwhite;font-size:0.8em;margin-left:0.5em\">Compatibility with Pathfinder Second Edition requires Pathfinder Second Edition from Paizo Inc.

the majority of any campaign.</p><p>Melee characters are listed with a range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p>Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party. If you are looking to challenge a high level party with generic underlings, either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.LVylAkC1NWnXxLul]{Troops} may be more suitable while maintaining a stronger sense of progression. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These NPCs have been designed to emulate player classes, although in many cases abilities have been simplified, condensed or reflavoured to make the NPCs easier to run for GMs. To appropriately capture the flavour of their respective classes, these NPCs with Class tend to have more abilities, than the other NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, making them more complex to run. These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon or upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. The NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental rules (+x potency rules, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">These NPCs are designed to have lower complexity than the NPCs with Classes and are particularly appropriate for use as supporting characters. For major named antagonists it may be beneficial to select one to two feats from an appropriate class, ancestry or skill to expand upon their versatility and make for a more complex villain. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">For higher level threats, the intention is that individual NPCs of this sort stop being a threat to the party, and you need to transition to using @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews}. I've intentionally not created any NPCs with jobs over level 12 to explicitly encourage this transition.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>In making these NPCs I have split them into seven different combat roles. Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

Given that inline rolls are the primary sort of damage roll used for troops, each troop is presented at a single level only rather than a level range. I don't recommend trying to modify your troops with the Weak and Elite adjustments unless you're prepared to make a number of manual adjustments.</p><p>Troops have been presented as Gargantuan creatures to reflect the rules, however, if you wish to have troops that can alter their shape per the rules in Form Up, you will wish to adjust the size to medium and place 16 medium tokens all linked to the initial imported actor. This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks. For troops that mostly rely on ranged damage or spellcasting, this adjustment is unnecessary. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Troop Creation Guidelines</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Full version of Mercenary Marketplace contains guidelines for creating your own troops.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>I find the weakness of Paizo's troops to Area Effect spells to be very unsatisfying, the weakness has the same effect whether you spend a first level burning hands spell or a 10th level meteor swarm.

My solution to address this grip was is to replace the weakness with a Area Effect Vulnerability, which decreases the degree of success for troops against area effect spells, thus making their effectiveness naturally scale with the power of the spell. If you find you'd prefer the standard troop weaknesses, remove the Troop Area Effect Vulnerability and give the troop a weakness with a value equal to double its listed weakness to splash damage.</p><p>Wherever possible I've chosen to create abilities for these troops that reflect the fantasy evoked by the troop's name.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Ancestry Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, a prompt will pop up asking which heritage you would like to apply to your NPC. The prompt will present a dropdown with the list of included heritages for that ancestry. If you are applying the Ancestry, Human (Ability Boost) template, it will first ask which ability boost you wish to apply, and then prompt you to select a heritage. The Ancestry Template will automatically apply the appropriate bonuses and penalties and, using the grant item rule element, add the selected heritage to your NPC.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the ancestries have small adjustments that could not be automated. For most NPCs, you will need to manually adjust the languages known to include those granted by their ancestry. If the ancestry or heritage you have selected increases the NPC's maximum HP, then you will also need to manually update their current HP to match. You will want to apply any other manual adjustments listed on your chosen ancestry or heritage during this step. If the NPC you have applied the template to had a pre-existing ancestry trait that was not human, you will need to remove that manually.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customize (Optional)</h3><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to make them feel like they belong to a specific ancestry without adding a lot of complexity. If you are creating an NPC for whom you wish their ancestry to be an important element of their character, and you would like that to be reflected in their mechanics, you might consider adding an ancestry feat or two. Items of the feat type cannot be added to NPCs so you will need to convert the feat to an action with an appropriate action cost, using passive actions to represent feats with no action cost.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>As mentioned above, there are two types of Ancestry Templates, Ability Boost Templates and Heritage Only Templates. The former include benefits based on the standard ability score boosts for each ancestry, while the latter do not. Neither of the templates is completely balance neutral. An NPC with an Ancestry Template will be slightly more powerful or flexible than an NPC without one. Generally, I recommend using the included Ancestry Templates when you would like an NPC's ancestry and heritage to be reflected mechanically in their character, with the choice between Ability Boost and Heritage Only Templates being a choice about the level of mechanical impact you want the character's heritage and ancestry to have.</p><p>If you want to design an NPC whose ancestry is more central to their character or backstory, adding 1-2 converted ancestry feats of an appropriate level, as mentioned in Step 5,  is an excellent way to reinforce the theme of that character. </p><p>If you would like a mechanically lighter option, for NPCs where their ancestry is of less importance, I suggest taking a look at the ancestry adjustments included in the \"Using the NPC Gallery\" section in Chapter 5 of the Gamemastery Guide, or applying one of the Heritage Only Templates and choosing not to select a heritage. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Ancestry Templates were designed to be usable with the various NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, and with those published by Paizo. I had made the assumption that the NPC you are applying any Ancestry Template to is human, consequently, the template will automatically remove the human trait if it is present, but any other pre-existing ancestry traits that the NPC has are not removed. While human is the assumed baseline, if the NPC you are applying the template to is of a size different than medium, it will still be adjusted to the appropriate size for the Ancestry Template you have selected.</p><p>The primary design goal in creating the Ancestry Templates was to create something that captured the core feeling of the various ancestries, while not having a dramatic impact on game balance. For me, a key part of capturing the feeling of the various ancestries was to reflect the ancestry ability boosts in the final result, such that a player could correctly infer that a dwarf would be hardier than average, while an elf or halfling would be more nimble.</p><p>A straight increase to the ability scores proved imbalanced, as even with offsetting penalties to counteract its effects it produced NPCs that were notably more effective if they happened to have one of the ability boost scores as a key ability, and notably less effective if they did not. To counteract these issues, I developed a set of benefits/penalties that could be granted for each ability that were relatively in line with one another in terms of the benefits they granted, while also feeling appropriate to the mechanics of the game. The final result is somewhat imperfect,  the six scores are not perfectly balanced with each other, and the effects are not entirely restricted to matching the benefits a player character would recieve for each ability boost. However, these benefits produce results results that are mechanically sound while being interesting and recognizable for your players. </p><div style=\"margin-left:2em\"><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Strength </strong>(+1 to Strike Damage (with Melee, Thrown, and Propulsive Strikes) and Athletics).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Dexterity </strong>(+1 to Reflex Saves, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery).</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Constitution </strong>(+1 to Fortitude Saves, and +1 HP per level)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Intelligence </strong>(+1 to Skill Checks)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Wisdom </strong>(+1 to Will Saves, Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival)</p><p style=\"padding:0;margin:0\"><strong>Charisma </strong>(+1 to Spell Damage and Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance)</p></div><p>Strength was in many ways one of the easiest to design. Athletics is a fairly potent skill that many creatures possess, and virtually all creatures have an option to deal some form of strike damage. And both of these these benefits/penalties have a relatively small impact compared to altering the NPCs strength-based attack rolls. </p><p>Dexterity was much harder to design, and it ended up slightly more potent that Strength. stripping out benefits to AC, and dexterity-based attack rolls from the benefits was a clear choice, but ultimately I decided a benefit to Reflex saves could stay. While a boost to Reflex saves is more likely to have a gameplay impact than +1 to damage, most spellcasters will have the ability to choose which save they target. Being able to look at a halfling, elf, or goblin as a player and go, oh, that NPC is going to be harder to hit with abilities that target Reflex feels good as it reinforces a sense of verisimilitude. And finally, I already knew I wanted to include a boost to Fortitude saves for Constitution, and including a save boost for Con and not Dex felt like it would undermine my attempts at creating verisimilitude. Including boosts of the various Dexterity keyed skills felt like an important thing to include for many of the same reasons. </p><p>Constitution was also fairly easy, a small increase to HP of 1 per level and Fortitude saves felt like pretty much the baseline power level of the benefits I wanted an ability boost to grant. The only wrinkle was making sure that a Constitution boost on a level -1 NPC or a level 0 NPC didn't have a counterintuitive effect, to prevent that from occurring the level used to calculate the HP increase was set to a minimum value of 1. </p><p>Intelligence was the black sheep of the family, while many of its skills are exceptionally useful for recalling knowledge it is fairly rare for NPCs to make recall knowledge checks in my experience, and granting additional trained skills was difficult to automate without being cumbersome. The compromise I reached was to have it increase all skills by 1, to reflect the opportunity a more intelligent creature would have to increase a broad variety of skills. Given that most NPCs have a handful of skills they use regularly while being untrained in the majority of skills the scope of this benefit is in many ways restrained to the skills each creature uses regularly, which falls roughly in line with the level of power I wanted these ability boosts to have. DCs for spells and effects were excluded for much the same reasons that Str and Dex boosts did not affect attack rolls. </p><p>Wisdom is another ability that ended up more potent than I would like, for the same reasons discussed with Dexterity I wanted to include Will saves in the ability boost benefits. And with Perception being both a useful attribute in general for countering PC stealth checks, while also being the most common determinant of initiative rolls it is also a potent benefit. On the plus side, the Wisdom skills of Medicine, Religion, Nature, and Survival, while useful, tend to be less commonly used by NPCs, which helps keep Wisdom from being the unparalleled star of the show, instead it ends up slightly better than average like Dex.</p><p>Charisma was in a similar boat to intelligence, while Deception and Intimidation are commonly used NPC skills, Charisma didn't seem to offer up enough benefits compared to the other ability boosts. Looking at what all I already had for the other boosts I realized that I had bonuses to each save, bonuses to strike damage and to HP, but no bonus to spell damage which felt like a nice counterpoint to strike damage. Given that Charisma is the default ability for all innate magic, it felt like the most appropriate ability to house what amounted to a spell power boost. </p><p>Now of course having designed all these benefits I realized that any NPC with an ancestry would end up with a net benefit compared to an NPC without one, even discounting anything the creature got from the base ancestry or heritage. If we treat humans as the default, then all your human NPCs will be slightly weaker and more boring than other NPCs, to counteract this I added a human ancestry with a single boost that is roughly equivalent in power to the other Ancestry Templates.</p><p>If you were to apply the Ability Boost templates uniformly to all your NPCs there would be a small but noticeable uptick in effectiveness; based on my experience I'd suggest this uptick doesn't alter the effective level of any individual creature, but when applied uniformly to all NPCs it could, for example, take an encounter that was just below severe up to severe. For GMs who don't want that, perhaps especially GMs that are running Paizo adventure paths whose players may already be struggling with the difficulty a template with a smaller effect on the NPCs would be preferable, for that reason I ended up including the same templates, heritages and all but without any ability boosts, these will have a much smaller effect on encounter balance, at the cost of a little loss of verisimilitude.</p><p>Ancestry heritages were primarily based on the heritages listed in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook for each of the six common ancestries. However, some of the heritages were difficult to automate in a satisfying fashion or otherwise were ill-suited to use on an NPC. To ensure there were an acceptable number of heritages available for each ancestry, additional heritages were invented that were inspired by a level 1 ancestry feat from that ancestry. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Credits & License","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h2 class=\"stylish\">Credits</h2><div style=\"margin-left:2em;padding-top:0.5em\"><p><strong>Authorship</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Game Design </strong>- Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Avery Rae</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>- Amanda</p><p><strong>Beta Testing </strong>- InfamousSky &amp; SkepticRobot</p><p><strong>The PF2e Foundry Team &amp; Discord Community</strong> - without the tireless efforts of which none of this could exist.

Apply Template</h3><p>Apply your selected Crew Template from Step 1 by dragging it to the NPC token or character sheet of your choice. After you have dropped it on the token or sheet, you will need to answer a prompt asking you the size of the base creature you have applied the template to. Once you have input the base creature's size, subsequent prompts will pop up asking which abilities you would like to add to your new Crew. Each prompt will present a dropdown of all of the Crew Abilities listed above, in alphabetical order. After you have made your selection(s) the template will automatically adjust the base creature's statistics, and use the grant item rule element to automatically add your selected crew abilities to the base creature.</p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 4. Manual Adjustments</h3><p>After applying your Crew Template and selecting your Crew Ability(s), there are a few manual changes you may need to make. Firstly, you will want to update the Crew's current HP to match its new maximum HP. You may also wish to update the base creature's name to reflect that it is now a Crew. If the base creature was a spellcaster, and you have given it Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting, or United Casting, you will need to update the creature's spellcasting entries according to the instructions for the relevant Crew Ability. These instructions can be found in the abilities' description tab, and follow the heading, \"template\". You may also find taking a look at some of the spellcasters from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} a useful example for how each of these three abilities modifies the base creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em><strong> -</strong> While the Crew Template has modified your creature's strikes, current limitations with the NPC sheets for the PF2e system on Foundry mean that the modified values  will not be displayed on the sheet, however the damage adjustment will apply correctly when rolled. </p><h3 class=\"dark\">Step 5. Customization (Optional)</h3><p><strong>Weak and Elite Crews -</strong> If you wish to apply an Elite or Weak template to adjust the strength of your created Crew, that adjustment should be applied now. The way Weak and Elite adjustments are implemented in Foundry VTT the order of application does not matter. You can apply the Weak/Elite adjustment either prior to, or after, applying your Crew Template.</p><p><strong>Crews with Ancestries -</strong> Should you wish to produce a Crew of a particular Ancestry, you may also apply one of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.QibnMkhhPYrIrwG5]{Ancestry Templates} to your Crew now.</p><p><strong>Additional Crew Abilities - </strong>The Crew templates are designed to increase the power of the base creature to represent the strength of a team of creatures working together. While the number of Crew Abilities granted was selected to provide an adequate bump in power for the increase in level for either version of the template, you may find you wish to create a particularly well-trained or coordinated version of a Crew. In which case, you may wish to add an additional Crew Ability to your new Crew by dragging it from the tables in Step 2. Or, perhaps you wish to create an especially poorly trained Crew. You can accomplish this  by creating a Crew with less Crew Abilities than usual. </p><p><strong>Crews with Descriptive Templates -</strong> The math for Crews has been constructed to scale with the Base Creature's level. If you wish to apply a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.ri8fswkWP7Bimh8l]{Descriptive Templates}, you should apply it first, before applying the Crew template, to ensure the Crew template functions as intended.</p><p><em><strong>Caution</strong></em> - Stacking Crew and Descriptive templates may produce results that are more or less powerful than expected based on the listed level adjustments.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Lore Justification</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Why are Crews, groups of 4 to 6 individuals, affected by magic and other effects as if they are a single creature? While I can certainly provide a number of mechanical and balance reasons, I believe that a satisfying answer needs to make sense within the world.</p><p>The default lore for how Crews work is sympathetic magic. By sympathetic magic what I mean is that there is some effect present that makes any magic cast upon on member of the crew resonate through all members of the Crew. I've got several possible explanations for the underlying cause of this sympathetic magic; feel free to pick your favourite for your world, include different explanations for different Crews, or invent your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual -</strong> The crew has undergone a ritual blending of blood, sharing of tattoos, or similar process which binds them together for good or for ill. This ritual allows the Crew to benefit from spells that would otherwise only affect one of them, though in exchange they are all affected by harmful spells that would target only a single creature.</li><li><strong>Deific Involvement -</strong> One of the deities has a particular love for teamwork, and smiles upon those who sacrifice their individual needs for the good of their fellows. Teams that train together, and act as one when facing their foes, receive this deity's boon, which creates a web of sympathetic magic between the members.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Resonance -</strong> The ties of sympathetic magic are not actually a conduit. Only a single creature might experience an effect, but either due to an empathetic response, or by disrupting the cohesion of the group, the aggregate effect on the group produces a result that matches what we might expect if it were cast on a single creature.</li></ul></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Crew Template has been designed so that you can safely substitute any individual creature for a Crew of the same level with minimal impact on the balance of your game. If you are running a campaign where the majority of adversaries are humanoids, you may wish to increase the proportion of crews your party faces as they level up. Doing so will create a clear sense of progression as their opposition is forced to send larger numbers of foes to muster an adequate challenge to your party. This can be particularly effective if you apply the Crew template to foes your players have faced before. </p><p>If you desire, Crews could make up the majority of the opposition in your campaign without any undue impacts on your campaign balance. However, if you do choose to take that approach, you will want to ensure the majority of treasure comes either from bosses or story/achievement rewards. The equipment carried by crews will typically be well below your party's level. </p><p>There is of course no requirement that the Crew Template be applied only to humanoids; any creature that is between size Tiny and Large can be turned into a Crew of creatures using the templates in Step 1. This is especially useful at high levels when you may find that there are fewer premade NPCs available for use with the template. Fey and Outsiders are prime targets to turn into high level crews. </p><p>While Crews were designed to represent groups of your party's weaker foes, if your narrative supports it a Crew can be a satisfying boss encounter. Many of the Crew Abilities give the Crew better action economy, making for more dynamic encounters.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>Crews materialized as a means to counteract the \"Bandit in Ebony Armour\" issue that is observed in games with level-based scaling like Oblivion or Skyrim. In these games as the players level up the whole world levels up with them, which can undermine any feeling of progression, especially if your party are facing similar foes. Crews are designed to counteract that experience that by allowing you to easily throw a group of lower level adversaries against your players, while still providing a challenge appropriate to their level. By expanding the scale of their combats, it creates a sense of progression. This can be particularly effective if you apple the template to foes the party has faced before. </p><p>The obvious question is:\"Why invent Crews at all, why not simply use troops?\" The answer is multi-faceted, but primarily comes down to maintaining game balance.  If you were to replace a large proportion of the creatures your PCs faced with Paizo's troops, AC becomes largely meaningless and Reflex saves play a disproportionate role in determining the defensive capabilities of the party. Moreover, on the offensive side Troop Defences shift the balance of the game considerably towards the use of low level, repeatable area effect spells as a means to reliably trigger the troops weakness and bypass the damage thresholds, while making many single target spells virtually unusable. Finally, troops are difficult to use in play, their unique mechanics and the sheer number of individual tokens to be moved (should you choose to utilize the troop's capability to spread out) make running them a lot of extra work. Meaning that Troops are best saved for the occasional encounter and are not viable as the bread and butter of your campaign.</p><p>With that in mind Crews have been designed to minimize any changes to the overall balance of the game while still allowing your players to feel as though they are fighting a large group of enemies. To this end a minor weakness to area effect and splash damage has been included to preserve the feeling of area effect magic being especially effective against groups of foes, and crews can be targeted twice for abilities such as swipe allowing your martial character who have specialized into fighting multiple foes to feel effective and in their element when fighting Crews (Note: this is not meant to include cantrips like electric arc which do not need the help, which is why I have worded the ability as effects which require you to select two adjacent creatures, but at your discretion you might choose to allow abilities like ricochet shot, through shot, or even a spell like scorching ray to target the Crew a second time. I recommend erring on the side of caution should you choose to do so, if an ability interpreted as being able to work this way seems too good to be true it probably is). But otherwise the Crew acts exactly like a single creature would, meaning spells and effects that target a single creature function normally for the Crew.  This means that aside from a minor buff to abilities designed to fight groups of enemies, the fundamental balance of the various offensive abilities is preserved. On the defensive side, Crews have standard attacks which mostly target AC, with the occasional creature having spells or abilities that allow it to target saving throws, in line with most other creatures in the bestiaries, this maintains the balance of the various defenses a player might choose from. </p><p>Now Crews needed to be higher level than the base creature otherwise they don't serve the stated goals. I wanted the Crews to be of a reasonable size to fit on most battle maps, and settled on a group of 4 to 6 individuals. With the understanding that working closely together would allow the individuals to stand closer together, meaning they could safely occupy an area roughly equivalent to that taken up by 4 individual creatures of the same size.  One unfortunate side effect of this is that Crew's composed of huge or gargantuan creatures are not feasible due to their size, which is a real shame I love the idea of a Crew of giants. Thinking about 4 squares for medium creature sort of naturally led to considering a level adjustment of +4.  To determine the appropriate amount by which to boost the various abilities and stats for the Crew Template, the Creature Building tables from the Gamemastery Guide were used as a baseline and I looked at the average increase a creature would experience to their checks and DCs when going up 4 levels, and imitated that, with the boost being lower for low level creatures to match the slower progression in values for creatures level 4 and below.</p><p>Now when you're advancing a creature by 4 levels, raw increases to its statistics are insufficient to create a compelling creature, the creature should also have more powerful and intersting abilities. To that end I created the Crew Abilities listed in Step. These abilities were created with a mind towards developing abilities that reinforced the theme of a group of individuals working together to great effect. Like many of the other abilities included in Mercenary Market Volume 1. I've generally tried to err on the side of abilities that are more active in nature, with many of the passive abilities improving the capabilities of existing actions. The most involved of these abilities are those that relate to spellcasting.</p><p>For spellcasters a raw increase in stats is unlikely to create a satisfying or effective opponent, so an alternate means of advancement had to be considered. Three primary abilities that were created to boost the Crew's spellcasting capabilities while reinforcing the theme of a Crew of lower level mages working together, Joint Summoning, Simultaneous Casting and United Casting . Each of these abilities reinforces the Crew's capabilities in a different way. Joint Summoning plays on the fantasy of a group of summoners working together to call forth powerful creatures to do their bidding by providing the Crew with extra slots of high power specifically for summoning spells, of the three abilities it represents a much smaller increase in power, meaning it can be used alongside either united casting or simultaneous casting. United Casting takes the idea of many mages working together to produce greater effects by raising the level of the base creature's spell slots allowing it to upcast any of its existing low level spells. Finally, Simultaneous Casting provides the Crew with more weaker spells and allows it to simultaneously cast a cantrip along with one of its spells each turn, it balances out this power by not granting the Crew any new higher level spell slots meaning its spells will always be below the party's level. Given the large power increase represented by both United Casting and Simultaneous Casting the two cannot be used together on the same Crew. </p><p>The Crew Templates let you quickly create a wide variety of crews from existing NPCs. With the Crew Abilities you can even generate different crews from the same Base Creature by selecting different Crew Abilities, to represent a group made up of the same foes that have undergone different training.  <br /><br />The last sticking point was the lore - how do we justify this group of four to six people being treated by various spells and effects as a single creature. I've included a separate dropdown entry with my lore justifications, so such a critical detail isn't lost in these ramblings.<br /><br />Ultimately I'm quite satisfied with the final result, as it allows for a campaign where your players face down a primarily human opposition without needing to have their opposition continually levelling up with them, instead you can slowly sprinkle more elite fighters and lieutenants in while using crews for the bulks of the opposition's forces. Especially at low levels the existance of the Ragtag Crew, which provides a +2 level adjustment allows for a steady sense of progression. Hopefully you'll find it as satisfying in play as I do.</p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example

intended to be direct replacements for individual NPCs of the same level, with minimal impact on balance. Thus, instead of introducing a new NPC mook of 12th level as your players fight their way through an organization, you might instead introduce a Crew made up of 8th level NPCs that the players have fought before. By utilizing Crews in this fashion, it will feel like their foes are forced to throw more enemies at them as they grow in power. More details about the design philosophy of Crews and their usage can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.9gfeVJcuMhGzcjlY]{Crew Templates} entry. </p><p>The Crews presented above are all pre-modified using the Crew Template, however as is typical for the Crew Template, their equipment has not been adjusted. In a campaign where you are making extensive use of Crews you will want to reward the party with loot from other sources, for example, story rewards or loot from bosses.  While you can add additional copies of each item carried by the Crew to more accurately represent all the arms and armour carried by the crew, doing so results in the party receiving a lot of low level gear that is, in my experience, not worth tracking.</p><p>As is typical for the NPCs presented in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1, Crews are presented with the bare minimum for gear, based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing solely on fundamental rune progression. When adapting these Crews for use in your games as adversaries, you may wish to equip your Crews with additional consumables that are narratively appropriate. </p></div></details></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Descriptive Templates","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Personality</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a collection of templates that allow you to modify your NPCs based on a descriptive adjective.

Manual Adjustments</h3><p>Many of the Descriptive Templates will require small adjustments that could not be automated. If the NPC's maximum HP has increased after the application of the template, you will need to adjust their current HP to match their new maximum. If your base creature has non-strike effects or abilities that deal damage, the damage of these abilities will need to be manually adjusted according to the instructions on each template. This is also an opportune time to review your chosen template for other required manual adjustments. If you have selected one of the level -2 templates you may need to adjust the creature's spellcasting entries. </p><p>Additionally, while you're reviewing your template, take note of any effects listed under the \"effect\" heading on the template, as these will need to be manually adjudicated during play.</p></div><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Usage</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These templates are designed to allow you to quickly adjust individual creatures to have particular evocative quirks, some of which may be positive and others detrimental.

the majority of any campaign.</p><p>Melee characters are listed with a range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p>Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p>NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon and upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. Please note however, the NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level, based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental runes (+x potency runes, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p>These NPCs are designed to be most appropriate for use as named antagonists,  either directly unmodified or tweaked to match your needs. While NPCs with Class can be dropped into the world to represent generic antagonists of the appropriate player class, care should be taken to avoid the Skyrim bandit problem, where all the background NPCs level up with the party. If you are looking to challenge a high level party with generic underlings, either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.LVylAkC1NWnXxLul]{Troops} may be more suitable while maintaining a stronger sense of progression. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>These NPCs have been designed to emulate player classes, although in many cases abilities have been simplified, condensed or reflavoured to make the NPCs easier to run for GMs. To appropriately capture the flavour of their respective classes, these NPCs with Class tend to have more abilities, than the other NPCs included in Mercenary Market Volume 1, making them more complex to run. These design choices make NPCs with class most appropriate for use as named antagonists. Although, these NPCs will still tend to have fewer  abilities than a PC of the same level, and no attempt has been made to include skill feats or ancestry feats, instead trading that versatility for the slight increase in raw power that is intrinsic to Paizo's creature building guidelines.</p><p>While we have attempted to capture the essence and flavour of each class, we have not restricted ourselves to the abilities and feats described in the core rulebook, some custom abilities have been created. While these new abilities have not been written up as player facing feats, they could be adapted for uncommon or rare player options. Although, if adapted without any tweaking, they will tend to be slightly more powerful than standard player options of the same level, as NPCs tend have fewer, slightly more powerful abilities, to make up for their lack of versatility and to make them easier to run.</p><p>Generally an attempt has been made to remove or modify abilities that are likely to be frustrating for players. For example, many classes get abilities to upgrade successes on saves to critical successes for their highest save, which given the relatively high saves of NPCs can be very frustrating for spellcasting PCs. To counteract this, we have omitted many of these abilities, except in cases were we felt these abilities were essential to the flavour of the class, such as Evasion on the Rogue.</p><p>The progression of these characters is modelled after that of their respective classes, with slight deviations as appropriate.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"JWFJTzMI86q256tm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"NPCs with Jobs","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">NPCs with Jobs</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of NPCs built to fill a particular combat role or job.  In volume 1, each role is represented by several NPCs.

range of three levels, for example [1-3]. The NPC is of the median level; however by applying either the Elite or Weak template, you can use those NPCs for the higher or lower level listed in the range. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">Spellcasting characters are listed with a range of two levels, for example [1-2]. You'll find the actual NPC is the higher of the two levels. Given the increase in power and versatility that comes with learning a new level of spells, it is recommended that you do not use these NPCs with the Elite template, but they are readily compatible with the Weak template. Furthermore, given the adjustments applied by the Weak template to spell damage, I do not recommend adjusting the number of spell slots.</p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">NPCs have been provided with a minimal amount of gear based on table 2-4: Safe Items from the Gamemastery Guide, focusing entirely on fundamental rune progression. While this means you can slot them into your game with a minimal impact on your party's treasure, if you are using them as the base for a significant foe you will want to expand upon or upgrade upon the gear provided, particularly in terms of consumables, worn or held magic items, and things like scrolls, staves and wands for spellcasting NPCs. The NPC statistics already reflect appropriate values for creatures of their level based on Paizo's creature creation guidelines, so if you are upgrading the fundamental rules (+x potency rules, resilience, striking) I would recommend exercising caution with changing those values, although applying the effects of property runes should be acceptable, especially if your players are level 5+. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">These NPCs are designed to have lower complexity than the NPCs with Classes and are particularly appropriate for use as supporting characters. For major named antagonists it may be beneficial to select one to two feats from an appropriate class, ancestry or skill to expand upon their versatility and make for a more complex villain. </p><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em)\">For higher level threats, the intention is that individual NPCs of this sort stop being a threat to the party, and you need to transition to using @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo.mmDemo-journals.1s34nyLF4vYUxsHX.JournalEntryPage.J5arLCsj7pbrI1eQ]{Crews}. I've intentionally not created any NPCs with jobs over level 12 to explicitly encourage this transition.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>In making these NPCs I have split them into seven different combat roles. Each NPC was designed to fulfill one or more of these combat roles, while remaining true to the core identity of whatever job that NPC has. Thus, abilities have been designed such that the Tactician has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who makes their living as a tactician, while the Necromancer has abilities that feel appropriate for someone who raises the dead, even through both act as leaders. In comparison to the NPCs with Class, NPCs with Jobs have been generally designed to have fewer and simpler abilities to make them easier to run; and while these NPCs can make for great named antagonists they tend to be simpler in design making them especially suitable for use as lackeys.</p><p>Many of these NPCs have brand new abilities that are particularly suited to their theme, these abilities will tend to be more powerful than a player's ability of the same level to compensate for the relative lack of breadth these NPCs have compared to player characters. However, with some tweaking, an ambitious GM could turn these unique mechanics and the progression demonstrated between the lower and high level NPCs with jobs into player facing archetypes. In general, many of these abilities are intended to be player visible. What I mean by that is, they should be discoverable with recall knowledge, and that the abilities have been designed to be things the NPCs actively do, rather than passive bonuses. Where passive bonuses do exist I've endeavored to make them significant enough and obvious enough based on the concept that I hope your players will be able to guess to avoid a particular tactic or save based on what sort of NPC they are facing. </p><p>I've only included NPCs with levels between 1 to 12 in this collection, with the notion that based on what Paizo has created, level 1 to 12 is a believable level of power for these more generic NPCs, and they could be feasible slotted into your adventure paths and Golarion games without breaking versamillatude. As your party moves into the mid to high levels individual NPCs give way to crews of NPCs to appropriately challenge your players, while creating a sense of realistic scaling in the scope and stakes of what your PCs are able to accomplish. With the Crew Templates these foes can thus remains viable threats up until the final few levels of your campaigns.</p></div></details></div></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"m3ez8MLOFi0NWUSH","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Troops","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"mmDemo-logo\"><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/pf2e-mercenary-marketplace-demo/art/MM.png\" /></div><div class=\"main-box\"><h4 class=\"mimic-h1\">Troops</h4><hr /><p style=\"width:85%\">Here you'll find a catalogue of all the new troops included in Mercenary Marketplace Volume 1.

Given that inline rolls are the primary sort of damage roll used for troops, each troop is presented at a single level only rather than a level range. I don't recommend trying to modify your troops with the Weak and Elite adjustments unless you're prepared to make a number of manual adjustments.</p><p>Troops have been presented as Gargantuan creatures to reflect the rules, however, if you wish to have troops that can alter their shape per the rules in Form Up, you will wish to adjust the size to medium and place 16 medium tokens all linked to the initial imported actor. This set up allows you to freely move the individual members around while still providing a single shared health bar. If you not wish to take this approach and would instead prefer to treat the troop as a gargantuan creature, then you will likely want to treat the troops level as one level lower, especially in the case of troops that predominately deal melee damage. The inability to alter the shape of the troop will have a strongly detrimental impact of the troop's damage output, as it will be unable to shift around to catch most of the party with its attacks. For troops that mostly rely on ranged damage or spellcasting, this adjustment is unnecessary. </p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Troop Creation Guidelines</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>The Full version of Mercenary Marketplace contains guidelines for creating your own troops.</p></div></details><details><summary class=\"exposition\"><h2 class=\"stylish-summary\">Design Philosophy</h2></summary><div style=\"width:90%;background-color:floralwhite;padding:10px 30px;margin-left:5%;margin-top:0px;border-radius:0px 0px 15px 15px\"><p>I find the weakness of Paizo's troops to Area Effect spells to be very unsatisfying, the weakness has the same effect whether you spend a first level burning hands spell or a 10th level meteor swarm. Whereas I feel that a higher level area effect spell used on a troop should produce a proportionately greater effect. My solution to address this grip was is to replace the weakness with a Area Effect Vulnerability, which decreases the degree of success for troops against area effect spells, thus making their effectiveness naturally scale with the power of the spell. If you find you'd prefer the standard troop weaknesses, remove the Troop Area Effect Vulnerability and give the troop a weakness with a value equal to double its listed weakness to splash damage.</p><p>Wherever possible I've chosen to create abilities for these troops that reflect the fantasy evoked by the troop's name.
